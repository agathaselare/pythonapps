# pythonapps
I made one of my python codes into a mobile app. It is a caesar style encoder/decoder but with a keyword. For more information about how it works I recommend checking out the python code it stems from (it has a few changes to make it functional in a mobile setting) in this link: https://github.com/agathaselare/python_proyects/tree/main/Encryption


It only runs in android
